# Ruter workflow for Alfred
The workflow allows you to manage your public transport trips in Oslo and Akershus (Norway) through Alfred. Now you can easily browse trips and know when to leave, directly from Alfred.

**There is currently a bug that makes the workflow fail if you select a start/stop point which is not marked by a tram/train/bus or tube on Ruter's website. Don't select points marked with [område] or points that is a street**

*This workflow is probably only of interest of those living in Oslo and Oslo and Akershus (Norway). It might serve as a basis for developing similar workflows in other cities/countries.*

## Installation
1. Download and import the workflow to Alfred
2. Open Alfred and type "ruter" to get started

## Feedback / Issues / Improvements
This workflow may contain bugs and is released "as is". If you encounter a bug or want to suggest improvements, please let me know [here](https://github.com/kimsyversen/ruter_workflow_alfred/issues). You are also very welcome to contribute.

*As this workflow is just developed, it might be a good idea to sometimes verify the information about a trip. Use the arrow keys and navigate to the route and press enter to see it on ruter.no*

## Disclaimer
This workflow is developed on a private basis and have no relation to Ruter other than it uses the official [Ruter API](https://ruter.no/labs/). 

## FYI
* All searches are performed based on the current time. It is currently no way to plan trips hours ahead.

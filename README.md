# Ruter workflow for Alfred
The workflow allows you to manage your public transport trips in Oslo and Akershus (Norway) through Alfred. Now you can easily browse trips and plan when to leave directly from Alfred.

It is probably only of interest of those living in Oslo andÂ Oslo and Akershus (Norway). It might serve as a basis for developing similar workflows in other cities/countries.
